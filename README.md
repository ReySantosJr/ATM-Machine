# ATM-Machine

Program Name: ATM Machine
The purpose of the program:
A mini-program that recreates the basic functions of an ATM machine.

This program was made for a project for my CMIS 242 class in UMGC.
The program is a simple example of ATM machine with letting the user withdraw, deposit and transfer money from savings to checking and vice versa.

The program starts with a default amount of $340 in the checking account and $120 in teh savings account.
